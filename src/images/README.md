# VSCode Destroy - Image Assets

This directory should contain the following image files:

- `bullet-hole.png` - Transparent PNG image of a bullet hole
- `glass-crack.png` - Transparent PNG image of a glass crack effect

You can create these images using graphic design software or download royalty-free images from stock photo sites.

If these files are not present, the extension will use CSS-based effects instead.
